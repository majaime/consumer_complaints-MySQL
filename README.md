# Consumer Complaints


## Problem Statement
The federal government provides a way for consumers to file complaints against companies regarding different financial products, such as payment problems with a credit card or debt collection tactics. This challenge will be about identifying the number of complaints filed and how they're spread across different companies. 

## My solution instruction
File is first decrypted to read the data. Then, the required stats are extracted according to the problem statement.
Finally, the desired outputs are recorded in a (.csv) file.

## Input dataset
I have provided an input file called `complaints.csv` in the input folder. The code, consumer_compleints.py, is located in the 'src' folder. A 'run.sh' file is also available at the root directory to execute the code and compare against the output.

## Output
My code provides an output file called `report.csv` after reading and processing the input file.
